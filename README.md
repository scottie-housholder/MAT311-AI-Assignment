# MAT311-AI-Assignment

This notebook is trying to analyze if we can predict if a charge is fraudulent or not. I used GitHub Copilot to help recreate the code given to us on day one of the class that does the analysis.


    This was my first time ever using AI for anything, let alone for writing code. I was shocked at how simple it was to generate everything. At one point, I had to restart the AI, so it no longer remembered anything. All I had to do was copy the code and feed it to the AI, and it was like I had never needed to restart it. I knew AI was a powerful tool, but the speed and simplicity it provides is shocking. It was honestly a little concerning just how easy it was to get lots of code so quickly.

    If someone had not learned data science properly, they would not know how to fix errors when they come up. If the AI wrote code analyzing the wrong column, for example, they might not know where to fix the error or how to check what columns are in the DataFrame to analyze. Also, if you have no data science experience, visualizing the data will be difficult. You need to prompt the AI to make the correct type of plot, and you will get weird output if you don't. I never had any issues in this assignment with the AI giving me bad output, but I did analyze it every time to be safe. The closest thing to a bad output I would get was when the colors in my barplots and countplots were not correct, and I verified this by comparing it to the output I was supposed to be creating.
